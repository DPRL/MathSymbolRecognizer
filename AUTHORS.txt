DPRL Math Symbol Recognizers
Copyright (c) 2014 Kenny Davila, Richard Zanibbi

This collection of classifiers for isolated handwritten math symbols was
created by Kenny Davila on-and-off over a year-and-a-half.  The code was
first created for a project for Dr. Zanibbi's Pattern Recognition course in
Fall 2012, was then used for the RIT entry in the CROHME 2013 handwritten math
recognition competition, and was then later extended and revised under Dr.
Zanibbi's supervision.

The system was developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology in
Rochester, New York, USA, primarily in the Document and Pattern Recognition
Lab (DPRL) located within the Computer Science Department.
